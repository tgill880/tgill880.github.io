#### About

I am a second career software developer.

My primary languages are **C++** and **Java**.

I am also handy with **Linux**, **bash**, **git**,  **GitHub** and **macOS**.

I am a **Software Engineer** at [Sound Life Sciences](https://soundlifesci.com).

#### Code and stuff

Here is a repository with some of my [sample code and projects](https://tgill880.github.io/sample-code).

I am also the primary co-author of the `chops-net-ip` and `utility-rack` repositories at [connectivecpp](https://connectivecpp.github.io), an open source, C++17 networking library. I have written the example code, and am porting the library to the [ESP32 chip](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview).
