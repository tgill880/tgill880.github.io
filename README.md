# Welcome to my GitHub

## Thurman Gillespy (tgill880)

I am a second career software developer.

My primary languages are C++ and Java.

I am also handy with Linux, bash and git/GitHub.

Here is a repository with some of my [sample code and projects](https://tgill880.github.io/sample-code).

I am also the primary co-author of the `chops-net-ip` and `utility-rack` repositories at [connectivecpp](https://github.com/connectivecpp), an open source, C++17 networking library. I have written the example code, and am porting the library to the [ESP32 chip](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview).

There is more info on my [LinkedIn page](https://linkedin.com/in/thurman-gillespy).
